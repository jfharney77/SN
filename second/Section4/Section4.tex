\section{Science Network Research}

We believe there are a number of novel research opportunities in designing, implementing, and producing the Science Network. Specifically, we have identified three concrete areas that may yield interesting research results. First, we will exploit the use of machine learning algorithms to extract valuable information that may be retrieved from the structure of the Science Network graph model. Next, we investigate methods to retrieve information from the data (i.e. the discoveries) contained in the network.
Finally, we identify the challenges in constructing suitable user interfaces for the system. We present a detailed description of each direction next.
